  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a computer science student at Polytechnic University of the Philippines - Manila, who loves to seek trendsetting knowledge, and heartfelt and real affiliations with other people. I'm game to roll the dice and put my progress on the line, even if I end up fashionably late, just to navigate the right process and ensure I truly grasp the pearls of wisdom being taught. Often perceived as a mystery to some, yet cherished as an effortlessly amiable companion by those who truly know me. Considering myself as a sentimental individual, I have a great passion in photography because I love capturing every single moment in life and take a glimpse at them once again.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>Aspiring to make a significant impact, I dream of a dual path: to serve as a software engineer or cloud architect while concurrently managing my own photography and videography production enterprise. My overarching goal is to contribute meaningfully to the progress of our nation, steering away from any preconceived notions of non-progressiveness. I am committed to being an integral part of the success narrative of technology in the Philippines, all the while bringing smiles and confidence to those who may not initially gravitate towards photography. I want people, especially those dear to me to join me on this journey of technological advancement and visual storytelling.</p>
  
  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
  <p>My short-term objectives for the current year include the completion of any fully paid online course pertaining to technology. This endeavor is integral to my ongoing journey of learning and skill enhancement. Additionally, I am committed to achieving success in both the departmental examination and the entirety of the first semester for the academic year. And, on a more personal note, I have got my sights set on learning the art of swimming as our main sport in PE before the year wraps up. Here's to a year of learning, acing exams, and making a splash!</p>
