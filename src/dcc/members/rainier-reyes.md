  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a computer science student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP). Prior to entering my course, I had no knowledge about computer programming, but within just a year, I learned a lot. Additionally, as I continue to learn more, I become more enthusiastic about it and think of exploring it further. Therefore, I have joined various organizations that can help me become more prepared and ready for the future.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>In the present, I have developed an interest in cloud platforms and services, as well as in protecting and securing information. In that sense, I aspire to become either a Cloud Solutions Architect or a Cybersecurity Analyst. With that in mind, I can explore uncharted territories in technology and provide services with minimal risk of hacking or encountering bug issues.</p>
  
  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
  <p>To succeed, improve, and learn</p>
