  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello, I'm Carlo, currently in my second year of studying IT and diving deep into the world of technology. I'm eager to understand the details of the IT industry, motivated by fear that my knowledge is not enough, so I need to learn and pick up new skills. Being more on the introverted side, I find comfort in the vast world of technology, where everything can be access within the swipe of the finger or a search from the web, this setup gave me the curiosity to following this path and for me to grow and learn. Honestly, the more I explore this field, the more I realize how much I still need to learn – it's a humbling experience. Nonetheless, I'm excited and hopeful, aiming to use each experience and lesson as a way to become better.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>Honestly, all I want is for people to remember me for the things I've done, whether it's achieving some success or just spreading a bit of kindness around other people. On top of all that, my goal is to be a good back-end programmer. I want to use the skills that I will acquire to make a real impact in the tech world. Just aiming for a legacy that’s a bit humbling, and maybe another dream is to just get by my life in a peaceful manner.</p>
  
  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
  <p>Improve the mind and be disciplined.</p>
