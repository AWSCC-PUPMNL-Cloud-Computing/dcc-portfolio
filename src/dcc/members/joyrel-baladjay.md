  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a BSIT freshman at Polytechnic University of the Philippines- Manila. Initially aiming fto major for Multimedia Arts and Animation, I ended up embracing the diverse landscape of IT during my first year. Active involvement in organizations like the CCIS student council, GDSC-PUP (as a UI/UX cadet), and AWS-PUP (as a cloud engineer) has honed my skills and boosted my confidence. This exposure pushed me out of my comfort zone, a crucial step in my professional growth. Despite lacking prior tech and coding knowledge, I'm committed to improvement. Daily practice, educational sessions, and completing curriculum-based projects are my strategies. I draw inspiration from successful women in tech, fueling my ambition to forge my distinct path in this dynamic field. I aim to embody their resilience, expertise, and innovation throughout my journey.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>My aspiration is to successfully navigate the realms of IT while integrating my passion and talents.</p>
  
  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
  <p>In 2024, my goal is to continuously push the boundaries of my knowledge, refusing to give up on the pursuit of growth. Simultaneously, I aim to cultivate a healthier lifestyle and mindset, surpassing any previous benchmarks for personal well-being.</p>
