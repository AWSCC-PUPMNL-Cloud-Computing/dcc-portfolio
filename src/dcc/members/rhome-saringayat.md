  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a Second-year IT student who is a beginner in the IT industry, but despite being a new-comer, my hunger for learning and knowledge in technology is nowhere near filled. I'm still solidfying my fundamental skills and foundation in this course, together with my passion and curiosity to continue exploring new things, will surely make me continue moving forward. I'm always willing to learn and discover new things in this industry, hoping to be able to contribute something in the future that help shaped the world in a positive impression.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>To be honest, I'm still not sure what my dream actually is, but I know for sure that someday I want to be able to walk this path of bringing home success in this industry. Success, however, for me is not just me standing on top and building my own world. I also define success as being able to influence other that are eager to learn, to become their role model and helping them achieve their own success. Though what my actualy dream is still uncertain, I'm confident to say that these are some of the things I want to do in the future.</p>
  
  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
  <p>To find my real passion in this industry and to be able to attend events that can impact my IT life...</p>
