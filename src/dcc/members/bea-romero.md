  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello there! I am a dedicated IT student with a deep passion for K-pop and a keen interest in the art of editing. Driven by a genuine love for learning, I am always eager to explore new avenues and acquire new skills. As an introverted individual, I find solace in organized spaces and thrive on the challenge of hard work. My insatiable curiosity fuels my journey to constantly broaden my knowledge and embrace new experiences. With a heart brimming with enthusiasm, I am on a quest to merge my technical prowess with my creative inclinations, all while maintaining a steadfast commitment to personal and professional growth.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>I dream of traveling the world and working in the field of information technology in another country. Traveling and exploring different cultures excites me, and finding a job abroad in IT would be a perfect blend of my passion for adventure and my professional goals.

  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
