I am a beginner in computer industry, however, that does not ends with “beginner” only. I’m a person who is full of curiosity. Thus, an active involvement in organization such as in GDSC-PUP (AL/ML Cadet), CFYV, and here in AWS-PUP pushed me to fill myself a significant knowledge. I am passionate and motivated when it comes to hardware and software, thus I entered the COED course to enhance and improve my skills and abilities so that in the future, I want to be one of the innovators or engineers in this world to contribute in humanity’s necessities and further improve the technologies. Moreover, I utterly to say that I am enthusiastic when it comes to hands-on, it fuels my heart to go further, learn more, dive deeper into tech world. Hence, with this dedication in devoting myself in hardware in software, it transcends my old me, resulting a Sheena that wants to be a group that solves solution in terms of computer hardware and software.</p>
