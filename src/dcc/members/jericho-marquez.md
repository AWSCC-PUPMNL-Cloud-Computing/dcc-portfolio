  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m a 2nd year student who is persistent in everything that I want to do. Being in this IT industry is a challenge for me since a lot is very new to me, but still I’m eager to experience and to learn more. I also like to explore things that are new to me. And in terms of my abilities, I can work well in both a team and on my own initiative and am somehow skilled with dealing with problems in a resourceful manner.</p>

  <h2>Dream</h2>
  <p>My dream is to become successful in this field and somehow provide the best life for my family, as well as to travel around the world with them along with my friends.</p>
  
  <h2>Goal This Year</h2>
  <p>To not be afraid to take risks about certain circumstances and to be a better version of myself compared to the previous years.</p>
